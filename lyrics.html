Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved and be loved?
Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya! Oh, no!
We've got a mind of our own
So go to hell if what you're thinking is not right!
Love would never leave us alone
Ay, in the darkness there must come out the light
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved?
Love your brotherman
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)
Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya
Oh, no
We've got a life to live
They say, "Only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive"
Stay alive, eh
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now, and be loved?
Say something (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something, say something
(Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something, say something (Say something)
Say something, say something (Could you be loved?)
Say something, say something (Reggae, reggae)
Say something (Rockers, rockers)
Say something (Reggae, reggae)
Say something (Rockers, rockers)
Say something (Could you be loved?)
Say something, uh
Say something, come on
Say something (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (Could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (Could you be, could you be loved?)
